For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.\nThe weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.\nYou can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren't carrying the weapon\n> If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature."
